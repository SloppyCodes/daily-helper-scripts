# Node.js Image Generator

This Node.js script generates an image with user input text and saves it to a file.

## Usage

1. Install Node.js and NPM.
2. Install the required packages by running npm install.
3. Run the script with node index.js [text], where [text] is the input text to be drawn on the image. If no input is provided, the default text "Hello, World!" will be used.
4. The generated image will be saved to output.png in the same directory as the script.

### Example usage:

`node textToImage.js "My custom text"`
